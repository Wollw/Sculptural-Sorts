\title{Sculptural Sorts}
\subtitle{An Artistic Investigation of Sorting Algorithms}
\author{David E. Shere}

\maketitle
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Main Document %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The modern society in which we live is increasingly reliant on technology
for its day to day functions.
In spite of this,
many people are still ignorant of even the basics of
how the devices they rely on work;
for many they are magical boxes handed down by the priests of technology.
In recent years this divide between those who understand technology and
the general population has grown.
The success of tablet computers and personal computers
which leave the user with little or no access to the system internals
seems to indicate that most people don't want to know more.
However, it is the openness of earlier popular platforms that gave users
the opportunity to discover the world being closed off.
Without this openness the barriers for entry into the world of technological
understanding will continue to grow.
